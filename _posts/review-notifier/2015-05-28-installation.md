This is a really simple module, once installed you simply need to enable the alert an configure the e-mail settings. You can do this at Magento Admin > System > Configuration > Catalog > Products Reviews.

Change "Enable New Review E-mail Alert" to Yes, enter the e-mail you would like to receive the alert at "Alert Email Recipient" and press "Save Config". Once this is done the next time somebody leaves a review you should then recive an e-mail.
