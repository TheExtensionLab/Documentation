This is a really simple module, once installed the only thing to do is to configure the custom contact url from the admin. You can do this at System > Configuration > Contacts > Contact-Us, simply enter a new url key e.g 'contact-us' in this field and hit "Save Config".

***Note***: Some links in your website e.g footer links static block may have the old url hardcoded in so you will need to update these.
