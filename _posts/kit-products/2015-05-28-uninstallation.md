To remove the extension Delete the products with the type "Kit Product" and them remove all the extension files a list of which can be found in the modman file.

It may also be possible to convert the Kit Products to another type saving some time if you have alot of kit products, however we have not looked into this possibility in enough depth to be able to reccomend a tool.
