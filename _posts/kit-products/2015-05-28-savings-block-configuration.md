The savings block is a small block, designed to to alert the customer of the potential savings of purchasing the items in the kit vs buying the items individually.

This block has 2 default options:
*An on/off switch : "Show Saving on Product Page".
*A minimum saving to display : "Minimum Base Price for Savings Block to display"

I would hope bboth are fairly self explanator and can be found at ```Magento Admin > System > System Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > Kit Product Options```
