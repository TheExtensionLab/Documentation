Before we begin, we reccomend creating the individual simple products that will make up the kit product. [Offical simple product creation guide](http://merch.docs.magento.com/)

Once you have the simple products you can then start with the Kit Product.

***Creating a Kit Product is very similar to creating a Simple product with only a few significant difference.*** First when you select "Create New Product" from
the products grid make sure to select Kit Product from the Product Type Dropdown.

There is also an extra tab labeled "Kit Child Products" this contains a grid for you to select the child products that this product in made up of.
This is were you slect the products to include in the kit along with the qtys of each item per 1 kit product sold. There is also a "Position" feild in the grid and this is used for sorting the child products in the "Contained In This Kit" Block that is displayed on the kit product page.
