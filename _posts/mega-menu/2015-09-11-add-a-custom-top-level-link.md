***Add a custom link to the navigation***

Sometimes you need to add a link to the Navigation that is not a category, in default Magento you need to edit the code to do this, but with this
extension you can simply add a "placeholder" (not active) category and give it an alternative internal or external link.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a category - and keep the "Is Active" set to no. (I'm going to assume you know how to do this if not [see here - ](http://merch.docs.magento.com/ce/user_guide/Magento_Community_Edition_User_Guide.html#catalog/category-create.html))
2. Under the MegaMenu Settings tab select either "Internal Link" or "External Link" for the link type.
3. For Internal links you simply need to provide the url key e.g 'contacts' in the link section.
4. For an external url put the whole url including http:// in the link section.
